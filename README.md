# WiFi Signal Strength Decision Tree
This project implements a decision tree algorithm to determine indoor locations based on WiFi signal strengths collected from a mobile phone. The goal is to create a decision tree that can handle continuous attributes and multiple labels. The implementation includes loading the dataset, creating decision trees, evaluating the tree's performance, and optional pruning.
