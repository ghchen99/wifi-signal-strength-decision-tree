# WiFi Signal Strength Decision Tree
This project implements a decision tree algorithm to determine indoor locations based on WiFi signal strengths collected from a mobile phone. The goal is to create a decision tree that can handle continuous attributes and multiple labels. The implementation includes loading the dataset, creating decision trees, evaluating the tree's performance, and optional pruning.

Figure 1: Illustration of the scenario. The WIFI signal strength from 7 emitters are recorded from a mobile phone. The objective of this coursework is to learn decision tree that predict in which of the 4 rooms the user is standing.
